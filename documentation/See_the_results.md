# See the results

When the network performance starts to approach 100 %, you may want to see the "candidates", i.e. the spectra belonging to the categories that you selected in the candidate classes option in your JSON configuration file.
- In order to do that, include "show_candidates":"yes", in your JSON configuration file and start the iteration.
- When the job gets completed, go to the Details.
- In the list of spectra, the candidates are highlighted in yellow.
- In the All metadata table, you will find the metadata of your candidates.
